# Implementation Plans

This directory contains all implementation planning documents.

## Plan Documents

- **`00_MASTER_PLAN.md`** — Overall project strategy and roadmap
- Future plans will be added as development progresses

## Status Tracking

All plan documents use these status indicators:
- ✅ Complete
- 🚧 In Progress
- ⏳ Pending
- ⚠️ Blocked
- ❌ Cancelled

## Maintenance

Plan documents are **living documents** — update them as you work:
- After completing tasks
- When approach changes
- At end of each session
- Before creating relay handoff documents

See `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md` for detailed guidelines.
