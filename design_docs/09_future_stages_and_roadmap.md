# CH Health OS — Future Stages & Feature Roadmap

## Philosophy
CH Health OS grows in layers.
Each stage adds depth without breaking daily simplicity.

No feature is added unless it:
- Reduces friction
- Improves adherence
- Respects explainability
- Aligns with real life

---

## Stage v0 — MVP (Current)
Focus: Daily adherence

- Routine Builder (time-based, expiring)
- Habits
- Exercise aligned to goals
- Weekly body composition input
- Daily AM Brief & PM Recap
- Telegram-first interaction (Vita)
- Gamification & family rewards
- Dashboard (basic)

---

## Stage v1 — Biometric Context
Focus: Context-aware adjustments

- Oura API integration
  - Sleep
  - Readiness
  - Activity
  - Stress
- Rule-based adjustments:
  - Training intensity
  - Recovery days
  - Sleep nudges
- Trend analysis (weekly/monthly)

AI Role:
- Explain patterns
- Suggest micro-adjustments
- Never override rules

---

## Stage v2 — Preventive Health & Medical Memory
Focus: Long-term health continuity

- Preventive Health Vault
  - Upload labs, reports, prescriptions
  - Structured extraction
- Lab tracking & retest planner
- Protocol adherence monitoring
- Clinical guardrails & escalation logic

---

## Stage v3 — Predictive & Preventive Intelligence
Focus: Anticipation, not reaction

- Pattern detection:
  - Adherence decay
  - Overtraining risk
  - Sleep debt accumulation
- Scenario simulation:
  - "If you skip X → Y impact"
- Gentle forecasting (non-alarmist)

---

## Stage v4 — Extended Ecosystem (Optional)
Focus: Integration, not expansion

- Wearables beyond Oura (only if justified)
- Nutrition integrations
- Optional clinician-facing exports (PDF summaries)

Out of Scope:
- Social networks
